<h2 class="headings"> Ways to use Images:</h3>
<p>For using images there are two ways. We can download the source file or we can use a CDN(content delivery network) , best practice is to download the image. For speed optimization HD quality images should be avoided as it increases site load time, the image should have an alt attirubute as it help screen readers to read the image or help to identify the image if it fails to load, if image size is to be specified then it is better to use width only . To use royalty free and No Copyright images we can use <a href="https://www.pexels.com/" target="_blank"><b>Pexels.</b></a></p>
